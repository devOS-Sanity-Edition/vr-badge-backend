     * This is an extremely vital class. This class is crucial for the correct functionality of
     * VR Badge Backend. This is extremely important, and cannot be removed under any circumstances.
     * This class single-handedly holds together the Engine. Without this class, everything
     * falls apart. This class is the reason humanity has not yet gone extinct. This class is
     * the only thing holding together the remains of the time-space continuum. Without this incredibly
     * crucial class, everything ever will fail catastrophically. In the event this class is removed,
     * expect you to go next, followed by the rest of humanity, and finally all of reality.
     * Once again, DO NOT REMOVE THIS CLASS.
